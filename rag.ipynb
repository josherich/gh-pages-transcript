We didn’t know a lot of stuff about SF and I think maybe the US is a bit different from Australia. But yeah, we’re very excited to be here.

The first one is, oh wait, the slides are at tinyurl.com/unof. Hopefully, that works. There’s also a Q&A section, so I’ll be monitoring Q&A. You can type any question that you like, and I will be answering questions as we go. That is at tinyurl.com/unofQA. If those two work, they’ll be at the bottom.

For example, the first tweet that we ever did was about some sort of approximate jelly bug issue. Multiple implementations of Gemma had different implementations; some of them used exact jell, some of them used approximate. So, which one is correct? That’s the question. We just tweeted about this. That was our first issue that we found. We thought this was just one issue, but actually, there were many issues, and we found more bugs.

Hopefully, this can be an open-source project where everyone can find these issues automatically and help us to solve these issues. I always thought about can we automate this? I don’t think it can be automated. There are actually many issues with these implementations, and it’s not just JMA. For example, we also analyzed Gro, and there are some weird things in their code, like they’re scaled by 30 * 10 h x over 30. It’s just a clamping mechanism. You can see I also make mistakes sometimes. I said it’s division and not multiplication, so sometimes I misread the code.

I’m assuming this is in preparation for Llama, 45 billion, right? They had to do this quickly, but there are some weird and interesting things, like they used the squared value and not the normal Swig glue. They were actually the first model trained using these other activation functions.

It’s actually one of the most important algorithms in all of math and computer science. It literally underpins many applications and is extremely important.

My brother did. It’s a bit outdated, but we have 11.9k or something. I don’t even know now, but we launched this last December. It generally makes fine-tuning of language models like Llama faster—two times faster, generally speaking. We have about 80% less memory usage now.

Reminder: there’s a common misconception that the P100s on Kaggle are faster; that’s actually not correct. I think P100s are five times slower than Tesla T4s. Although it’s more expensive as a GPU, it’s actually slower. Please do not select the P100s on Kaggle.\\nKaggle has 30 hours for free per week GPUs, and you get two Tesla T4s, so that’s 130 teraflops per week. That is actually very powerful.

Be careful of Nvidia’s marketing—it’s times two because it has sparsity. Just be careful of that and also be careful of the flops when it’s like float 8 or float 16.

Yes, back to the sparsity question: the sparity feature allows you to take 50% of the weights and make them go to zero. Nvidia essentially allows you to train this two times faster by not doing matrix multiplications on the zeros. You’re like two * Z is just zero, so you essentially don’t fire the transistors, and this makes it two times faster.\\nThat’s a higher-level overview but essentially, you compress the matrix into this special format, and this Nvidia special format allows you to do multiplications two times faster. It’s on H100s and it’s on A100s as well. Your RTX 3060 and RTX 30 series have that feature.

If you know OpenAI, they keep saying, “It’s two times faster for a reason.”\\nI wonder why; is it due to sparsity or float 8? Float 8 is generally two times faster, albeit not exactly but approximately. When you hear “two times faster,” where does that come from? Could it be these things?\\nYes, any other questions?

Sorry, okay, two kind of related questions on precision. First one is like why is that bit—you must have the sign bit. Yeah, you don’t have to, but it’s generally standard practice to have the sign bit.\\nIn theory, you don’t have to. The only problem is if you don’t have a sign bit, your numbers will be 0, 1, and 2, right? But then what happens if you wanted to—like you’re trying to not make the model learn negative directions anymore? You could do that.\\nI don’t know if there are papers; maybe you should write a paper about that—train a model on that and let’s see what—okay, but yeah, related, I think all—yeah, softmax, you’re basically just linearly fitting—you know? There’s nothing about—that could be wrong. The reason is because remember when you do softmax, you also have to normalize the sum of the exponentials.'),\n",

Well, but you’re not—you’re not likeing it; you’re just square rooting it. No, no, it’s the sum of exponentials divided by—sorry, the exponentials divided by the sum of the exponentials.\\nYeah, but the big exponential dominates, right? Yes, that’s the problem, though. If you do that, then your model’s not learning; you’re just trying to learn to predict one token. Why don’t you just predict that one token then, like the largest one that you did?\\nThat’s kind of what you’re forcing the model to not learn anything—that is why you have to subtract the maximum. That’s a trick that we showed, like minus the maximum, and then you can reduce this effect of this one token, or this one issue. So it’s for training stability purposes.'),\n",

Yes, that is a good question. To be honest, I do not know. I don’t think so; it changes too much. Layer norms—if you upcast, it’s probably a small effect—a small effect. But the reason why you need to upcast is because JMA did it before, so you have to do it.\\nRemember, the trick is you must follow what the original implementation does. Any other questions? Okay, there are some other issues which we showed. It’s funny because it’s all about upcasting, downcasting, and stuff like that. Each implementation does its own thing.\\nUnfortunately, how do you actually analyze this? You have to open three screens up—the DeepMind one, the DeepMind one—okay, okay too—excited. You have to open up three implementations—the DeepMind one, the Hugging Face one, the Carass one. You have to open three screens, and you see line by line what did they do.

Guessing, so that’s probably why it can’t be automated, right?\\nThese error checking things cannot be automated because there’s a human there which made these decisions, and so you have to—now you have to decide which one— which of those decisions did they choose.

If you do this, we show that float 32—remember we showed before that in the fixes that we did, the lines sometimes go back up, right?

Um, anyway, and finally to serve it, you can just do the model file to serve it. Um, and you can serve this. Um, and we do have a CSV version, so you can actually use the Titanic dataset.\\nOkay, it’s loading. Um, so if you want to use the Titanic dataset, you can upload the Titanic dataset, right? I uploaded the Titanic CSV. You can use the CSV file for this. Um, and again, you have to merge columns and so on, right? This is a more complicated example.\\nIn fact, I provide this entire example for you for the entire Titanic dataset to merge all the columns into one. Um, and it’s the same exact output. So that’s a notebook that we’re sharing for—we did not release this yet. So this is for you guys to experiment and see if there are any issues.'),\n",

And also, yeah, we have Q&A now.\\nYeah? Yes! Oh, did you measure the difference between writing the CSV content in English sentences as opposed to just the JSON format? The problem is, if you put them in JSON format, you still need to have instruction and output.\\nSo how would you do that? You need to have two columns only for fine-tuning. Can you do—like in your template, here you have instruction, and then you add all—the—yeah, you add all the other columns onto it. Can you?\\nYou could. You could do the JSON file yes, you can. But we just show you that you can do multiple columns now. So like if you have like 10 columns, you can now make the ten columns into one by merging them together.'),\n",

Oh no, you can’t use—you mean like you shove the actual dictionary for fine-tuning?\\nYou could do that. I don’t—I think you should do English language because a language model predicts the next word. JSON is probably less useful. Always convert it into English. I have the same intuition; I was wondering if you measured it. Research paper?\\nYes, it should be another research paper. Yeah, any other questions? So there’s a lot of upvoted questions from me in the chat.\\nSorry, I was wondering if you could take a look at them. I didn’t actually check the slider questions. Whoopsies.
